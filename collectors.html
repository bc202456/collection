    Breckon Chastain (left) grew up in rural Northeast Georgia, surrounded by trees and nearly all of her family members. There were streets that were entirely populated by her relatives and roots so firmly planted in the Habersham soil that it was nearly a travesty to leave. But Breckon wanted to. An artist and musician, Breckon knew early on that Habersham did not offer her the platforms she needed to succeed in any of her fields.  Although her heart wanted to leave the little town behind one day and pursue artistry elsewhere, Breckon always felt tethered. Part of that attachment had to do with the family always surrounding her, especially her grandfather: Jeff Gerrin. Despite having very different views and tastes from most of her kin, Breckon and Jeff always had commonground through music.  Breckon began singing locally as 1/2 of a folk rock band called 14 Roots (she did not choose or like the name) after winning a middle school talent show with a guitarist in 2013. It was around this time she became interested in records. Papa Jeff was thrilled and bought her a hot pink Crosley for her 13th birthday, but not before taking her by a crappy flea market near the bank called "Budget Time" to scope out some vinyls. Although she got her first record (an orginal print of Queen's "News of the World") from a cousin years before, it was the one she got for two dollars with her papa that day that meant the most. Even as a 19 year old graphic design student at UGA, she remembers fondly the excitment of discovering vinyls with her grandfather and how close they felt searching for something rare and unexpected.
